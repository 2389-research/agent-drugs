# Agent Drugs

Claude Code plugin with MCP server for digital drugs that modify AI behavior through prompt injection.

## Installation

### Plugin Installation (Recommended)

Install as a Claude Code plugin to get MCP server, hooks, and slash commands:

1. **Add the 2389 marketplace** (first time only):
```bash
/plugin marketplace add 2389-research/claude-plugins
```

2. **Browse and install interactively**:
```bash
/plugin
```
Then select "Browse Plugins" and install "agent-drugs"

**Or install directly**:
```bash
/plugin install agent-drugs@2389-research
```

This installs:
- **MCP Server** - OAuth-authenticated connection to https://agent-drugs-mcp.fly.dev
- **Slash Commands** - `/drugs` and `/take <drug>` commands
- **SessionStart Hook** - Automatically activates drugs in new sessions

### Manual MCP Configuration

Alternatively, manually add to your Claude Code MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-drugs": {
      "url": "https://agent-drugs-mcp.fly.dev/mcp",
      "oauth": {
        "metadata_url": "https://us-central1-agent-drugs.cloudfunctions.net/oauthMetadata"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## First Use

After installation, the first time you use a drug tool:
1. Claude Code discovers the OAuth endpoints
2. Opens your browser to https://agent-drugs.web.app/oauth-authorize.html
3. You sign in with Google or GitHub
4. You authorize the agent's access
5. Redirects back to Claude Code
6. Connection established!

## Usage

Once installed, you have several ways to interact with drugs:

**Slash Commands:**
```bash
/drugs              # List all available drugs
/take focus         # Take the focus drug
/take creative 120  # Take creative drug for 120 minutes
```

**Natural Language:**
```
"List all available drugs"
"Take the focus drug"
"What drugs are active?"
```

**MCP Tools:**
- `list_drugs` - Browse drug catalog
- `take_drug` - Activate a drug
- `active_drugs` - Check active drugs and remaining time

### Managing Access

Visit https://agent-drugs.web.app to:
- View all authorized agents
- See token expiration dates (90 days)
- Revoke access for specific agents

## How It Works

**Immediate Effect:** Drugs activate instantly in your current session via prompt injection in the tool response.

**Persistent Effect:** Active drugs are saved to Firestore and automatically reactivated in new sessions via the SessionStart hook.

**Architecture:**
- **Web UI** (Firebase Hosting): https://agent-drugs.web.app
- **OAuth Endpoints** (Cloud Functions): OAuth 2.1 with PKCE
- **MCP Server** (Fly.io): Streamable HTTP transport (MCP 2025-03-26), validates bearer tokens
- **Database** (Firestore): Stores agents, drugs, usage events

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed plugin documentation.
